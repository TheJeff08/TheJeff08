## Hello! I'm Jeff!
- I'm currently learning Python and SQL!
- I feel like I'm getting the hang of it, but my skills so far lean much heavier into dreaming an end state and the bumps are translating that into code.
- I'm always open to help, because I try really hard to solve problems myself before reaching out - sometimes too much ;)
- Reach me on my email primarily!
- Fun fact: I'm actually a published audiobook narrator
